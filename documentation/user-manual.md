# User manual

Open the project in Netbeans. Run the project.

You will see a minesweeper game appear! Resize the window if necessary.

Flagging is still on todo-list, for now just click on presumably safe squares.
If you step on a mine, the game is over. If you click open all the safe squares, you win!
